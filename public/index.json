New users can sign in and create or join an existing chatroom. Once a channel is selected, users can communicate in real-time, with the help of WebSockets. The users also have an option to create new channels for communication. Flack uses Flask for the Backend and Javascript, HTML, CSS, BootStrap for the front-end. The user\u0026rsquo;s information is stored in the PostgreSQL database. The final application is deployed on Heroku and is available at the link The image attached above shows two users communicating with each other in real-time.

The system detects the face and identifies 68 facial keypoints. Facial keypoints are the small green dots shown on each of the faces in the image above. These keypoints mark essential areas of the face: the eyes, corners of the mouth, the nose, etc. These key points are relevant for a variety of tasks, such as face filters, emotion recognition, pose recognition, and so on. Once we identify the key points, we can quickly get the pixel coordinate information, which is very useful to add objects over the face.\nAs an example, we first identify the key points using the deep learning model developed and the image with key points is here: Then we add sunglasses using the coordinates of eyes, and the resultant image obtained is below:  A small demo for this project is available at this link on youtube.\n  ","date":1571451355,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571451355,"objectID":"d5fa1f8f7fc54697e9a80c20ebb0603e","permalink":"/project/facial_key_point_detection/","publishdate":"2019-10-18T19:15:55-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/facial_key_point_detection/","section":"project","summary":"Developed a Facial keypoint detection system by training a convolutional neural network on Youtube Faces dataset.

Existing datasets are typically limited to a single hand. By exploiting the visual cues given by an RGBD sensor and a pair of colored gloves, we automatically generate dense annotations for two hand segmentation. This lowers the cost/complexity of creating high quality datasets, and makes it easy to expand the dataset in the future. We further show that existing datasets, even with data augmentation, are not sufficient to train a hand segmentation algorithm that can distinguish two hands.

Based on the spectral distance between specific subcarriers and PU bands, the scheme allocates power among a minimum number of PU adjacent subcarriers with a water level that is different from the ‘far-away’ subcarriers. The proposed ‘n-adjacent’ approach is subjected to both aggregate and individual PU band interference constraint. Unlike some of the existing methods, the proposed method is capable of meeting the constraints including the contribution of ‘good quality’ subcarriers even when they are close to PU bands. Comparison of results for a wide range of power budget shows that the improved method, using the same complexity, can achieve higher cognitive user capacity with greater power allocation efficiency.","tags":[],"title":"A Spectral Distance Based Power Control Scheme for Capacity Enhancement of OFDM Cognitive Radio","type":"publication"}]
