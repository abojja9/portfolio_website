## Summary:

1. Developed an online messaging service using Flask, similar in spirit to Slack. 
2. New users can sign in and create or join an existing chatroom. Once a channel is selected, users can communicate in real-time, with the help of WebSockets.
3. The users also have an option to create new channels for communication. 
4. Flack uses Flask for the Backend and Javascript, HTML, CSS, BootStrap for the front-end.
5. The user's information is stored in the PostgreSQL database.
6. The final application is deployed on Heroku and is available at the [link](http://flack-messenger.herokuapp.com)
